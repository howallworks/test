This research examines the issue of equality of inertial reference frames, that is, the assumptions of the special relativity that by conducting identical experiments in any inertial reference frames, identical results will be obtained. Experimental data on the lifetime of short-lived particles prove that identical experiments in different inertial reference frames lead to different results. This leads to the conclusion that the first postulate of the special relativity is erroneous and that inertial reference frames are unequal. Based on this, it is assumed that the zero level of dipole anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation is an absolute inertial reference frame, relative to which all relativistic processes of any objects are correctly calculated.
### Introduction

Albert Einstein's special relativity has been well studied and accepted as the basic concept corresponding to the current interpretation of the structure of our universe [1-15]. Currently available experimental data on relativistic time dilation relative to the center of the Earth are in good agreement with the predictions of the special relativity [33-38]. Experimental data on the lifetime of short-lived particles relative to the center of the Earth also agree well with the predictions of the special relativity [16-29], but do these same experimental data prove the equality of any inertial reference frames and, accordingly, the truth of the first postulate of the special relativity? The answer to this question is not as simple as it seems.

#### Experiments with short-lived particles proving the inequality of inertial reference frames

In this section, we will compare a pair of identical versions of an experiment similar to the twin paradox, which differ only in the choice of the basis inertial reference frame. In fact, the first postulate of the special relativity is being tested on the basis of this pair of experiments, that is, the assumption that any physical processes in these inertial reference frames proceed the same way and identical experimental results will be obtained.

Consider the twin paradox of the special theory of relativity [1-15]. One twin stays on his home planet, and the other gets on a spacecraft. The beginning of a thought experiment. The spacecraft accelerates to the velocity $v$, close to the speed of light relative to the home planet in a time tending to zero. Then it moves for a long time - $t$. Then it accelerates to travel back to the velocity $-v$, close to the speed of light relative to the home planet in a time tending to zero. Then it moves for a long time - $t$. Then it accelerates to a speed equal to zero relative to the home planet. The spacecraft is on its home planet. The end of the thought experiment.

It is believed that the "traveling" twin will always be younger than the "stay-at-home" twin. Let's check it out. Let $t$ be one year by the clock on the home planet. Let's choose $v$ in such a way that the time dilation coefficient is equal to 1000.

Let's consider the classic version of the experiment. Let the home planet be Earth. We get that the first twin has aged 2 years, and the second twin has aged 1000 times less. That is, the clock on the spacecraft ticks 1000 times slower than the clock on the home planet. Nothing interesting.

Let's consider a non-classical version of the experiment. Let the home planet move with a velocity vector $-v$ relative to the Earth. Then, after the first acceleration, the spacecraft will rest relative to the Earth and, unfortunately, at this stage, the second twin will grow old and die (in accordance with experimental data on the relativistic dynamics of short-lived particles [17-26]). We get that the first twin has aged 2 years, and the second twin has long died (already at the first long waiting time $t$) and the spacecraft has completed all the necessary steps on autopilot. That is, the clock on the spacecraft ticks 1000 times faster than the clock on the home planet at the first long wait for the time $t$. It is here that we get a contradiction between the predictions of the special relativity, which claims that the clock on the spacecraft will tick 1000 times slower than the clock on the home planet, and experimental data on the relativistic dynamics of short-lived particles, proving that the clock on the spacecraft will tick 1000 times faster. During the second long wait for the time $t$, the clock on the spacecraft ticks 1000 times slower than the clock on the home planet. In this case, it is important for us to know how much time will pass by the clock of the spacecraft and how much time will pass by the clock of the home planet, since the age of the twins depends only on this.

In order to be humane and not waste the life of one of the twins on this experiment, we can do with short-lived particles, the lifetime and time dilation for which is well known experimentally [16-29]. Both experiments are easy to reproduce. If the lifetime of the particles is $10$, then according to the special relativity, at the end of both versions of the experiments, the same result should be at the end. The remaining lifetime of the first particle will be $10-2=8$, and the second particle will be $10-0.002=9.998$ due to the time dilation effect. However, according to experimental data on the lifetime of short-lived particles [16-29], in the non-classical version of the experiment, even with the first long wait, a time equal to $1$ will pass for the first particle (the particle moves with a time dilation coefficient equal to $1000$ relative to the Earth), and for the second particle - a time equal to $1000$ (the particle moves without time dilation relative to the Earth). Therefore, experimentally, the second particle will decay almost at the very beginning of the first long wait. The contradiction between the prediction of the special relativity and experimental data is obvious. As a result, we get that in the classical version of the experiment, the second short-lived particle will live longer. In the non-classical version of the experiment, the first particle will live to the end of the experiment, and the second particle will decay already at the first long wait and there will be nothing to accelerate at the next stage.

We get that the "traveling" twin will not always be younger than the "stay-at-home" twin.

It should be particularly noted that the classical and non-classical versions of the experiments differ only in the choice of the base inertial reference frame - the home planet, and everything else is identical. That is, the difference is solely that the relative velocity between the selected home planets is $v$. All other actions with spacecrafts or short-lived particles are identical: accelerations, velocities, time according to the clock of the inertial reference frame.

As a result, we conducted two identical experiments in different inertial reference frames. Based on the first postulate of the special theory of relativity, the result should be the same, since it is assumed that inertial reference frames are equal (that is, any physical processes in these reference frames proceed the same way) and can be described by general laws. However, practice shows that this assumption does not correspond to reality, since absolutely opposite results are obtained for different inertial reference frames. In the classical version of the experiment, the second short-lived particle will live longer, and in the non-classical version of the experiment, the first short-lived particle will live longer. As we can see, inertial reference frames (for different versions of resting home planets or short-lived particles) are unequal and cannot be described by general laws. 

Next, let's figure out what the reason for all this is.

### The assumption of the existence of an absolute inertial reference frame

In fact, the effect of time dilation is to increase the duration of processes in clocks. The number of these processes, based on the definition of the term second, is taken as a unit of time. It turns out, based on experimental data on the dynamics of short-lived particles, time depends on the speed of movement relative to one specialized inertial reference frame - the zero level of dipole anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation [30-32]. Due to the fact that the Sun's velocity relative to zero level of dipole anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation is almost absent by relativistic standards (370 km/s), short-lived particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light relative to the Earth - live longer  (the classic version of the experiment). However, in the non-classical version of the experiment, the first short-lived particle was chosen as an inertial reference frame, which is already moving at a speed close to the speed of light relative to the zero level of dipole anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation and, consequently, experiences a strong time dilation (a coefficient of 1000 was chosen). At the same time, by accelerating the second short-lived particle for the first time to a velocity $v$ relative to the first short-lived particle, we actually slowed down the second particle to almost zero relative to the zero level of dipole anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation and, consequently, it ceased to experience the effect of time dilation and quickly decayed.

### Conclusion

Experimental data on the dynamics and lifetime of short-lived particles prove that inertial reference frames are unequal and, conducting identical experiments in them, we obtain different results [16-29]. As a result of the fallacy of the first postulate of the special relativity, it is assumed that relativistic effects can be correctly calculated relative to the absolute inertial frame of reference - the zero level of dipole anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation.
