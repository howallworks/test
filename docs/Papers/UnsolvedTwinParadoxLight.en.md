The paper presents several types of new advanced thought experiments similar to the twin paradox and the results of their analysis.

A description of a thought experiment is presented in which, when calculated using the theory of relativity, objects move at a speed tending to infinity, which contradicts the theory of relativity.

The results  prove that different inertial reference frames are unequal and cannot be described by general laws.

To eliminate these problems, a special inertial reference frame has been proposed with respect to which calculations can be performed and results consistent with reality can be obtained.
### Introduction

The twin paradox is the thought experiment which was invented after Einstein formulated the special theory of relativity (STR). In this experiment, it is not clear which object is experiencing time dilation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Then several scientists pointed out that there is no paradox. They have come up with a number of methods to explain what is happening in this thought experiment [8,9,10,11,12,13]. However, these methods use additional means that are not related to the special theory of relativity.

If we consider solutions exclusively within the framework of Einstein's special theory of relativity, then they are valid only for a narrow range of cases and are in general incorrect. Let's conduct a thought experiments to prove it.

### New advanced versions of thought experiments similar to the twin paradox

For further description, it is necessary to introduce a new term.

An immobile frame of reference (ImFR) is an inertial frame of reference (IFR) associated with an object characterized by zero shift of cosmic microwave background radiation (zero dipole anisotropy). The ImFR can be associated with different objects, but their relative speed is zero.

For all thought experiments, let's take two spacecraft with synchronized clocks (or two short-lived particles obtained at the same time). They move only along one coordinate axis for simplicity. Let $v$ is their velocity relative to the ImFR (or with an error relative to the Earth). The time spent on accelerations is considered negligible. 

Thought experiment 1 description:

1. Begin with both objects flying together at velocity $v=0$. The first one always rests. 
2. Let's accelerate the second one to a velocity tending to $c$. 
3. Wait a significant amount of time $0.5t$. 
4. Accelerate the second one to a velocity tending to $-c$. 
5. Wait a significant amount of time $0.5t$. 
6. Accelerate the second one to $0$. 
7. End of the thought experiment with both objects flying together. 

Results will be obtained in the ImFR using the formula (2):  

- spacecraft 1: $t_1=F(0)(0.5t)+F(0)(0.5t)=0.5t+0.5t=t$; 
- spacecraft 2: $t_2=F(c)(0.5t)+F(-c)(0.5t)\to0$.

Let $t$ be equal to a billion years. A typical pattern is observed in the ImFR and should coincide with the results of real experiments.

Now let's see what will be observed from the point of view of each of the spacecraft according to the theory of relativity.

The results of the first spacecraft will be identical to the results in the ImFR, since the reference frame is the same.

For the second spacecraft, the change in its own time recorded on the clock will tend to zero (it should coincide with the results of real experiments). However, colossal changes will be recorded in the structure of the universe during this time. Objects whose speed tends to the speed of light in the ImFR will travel a distance of almost a billion light years. This means that their speed relative to the second spacecraft should have been tending to infinity (a billion light-years divided by time tending to zero). However, this is impossible according to the theory of relativity, since the limiting speed must be equal to the speed of light.

We get a contradiction: 

- or the speed of objects can tend to infinity with almost zero time change on the clock of the second spacecraft. This indicates the fallacy of the theory of relativity, but corresponds to reality.
- or on the clock of the second spacecraft, the same amount of time must pass as for the first spacecraft (a billion years) in order to preserve the limit speed of light for the objects of the universe. This fits into the concept of relativity theory, but contradicts reality.

It is worth noting that what is happening cannot be explained by the Lorentz contraction of length, at least because it does not affect the plane perpendicular to the axis of motion. There, objects whose speed tends to the speed of light in the ImFR will travel a distance of almost a billion light years.

In fact, we get that the universe has changed by a billion years, but the time for the second spacecraft has almost unchanged.

This is confirmed by experimental data, for example, for short-lived particles accelerated to speeds close to the speed of light. In fact, for these cases the universe has changed for a time that is orders of magnitude greater than the particle’s own lifetime (such particles decay by several orders of magnitude faster when rested in ImFR). Of course, the Lorentz factor is not as high as in the thought experiment, but this is a purely technical problem.

In the theory of relativity, time always slows down for moving objects relative to IFR. However, in reality, in a wide range of cases, in order to get the right result, time must accelerate. In fact is that all IFRs are unequal and cannot be described by general laws, the concept of relativity is erroneous and our universe is absolute. 

### Conclusion

Einstein's theory of relativity doesn't use and doesn't give an understanding about of the absolute characteristics, namely the initial velocities of the studied pair of objects. In addition, it also doesn't give an understanding of whether an object is accelerating or decelerating, since only relative velocities and accelerations between objects are important in it. That is the essence of this theory. And it is this concept of relativity that makes the theory of relativity erroneous in the general case.

Of course, the assumption that the ImFR is an inertial reference frame relative to which everything in the universe is correctly calculated requires careful verification. However, based on the analysis of the above-described thought experiments, it can be argued that Einstein's theory of relativity and the concept of relativity of the universe are erroneous, since in a wide range of cases they do not correctly describe the behavior of objects qualitatively and quantitatively. 

Also have been obtained results proving that different IFRs are unequal and cannot be described by general laws. This leads to an understanding of the absolute structure of the universe. In fact, it is assumed that the ImFR is at rest within the framework of the concept of the absolute universe. This is the basis for building the concept of the absolute universe. Based on this, it is the speed relative to the ImFR that is the key parameter determining how much time the clock will show.
