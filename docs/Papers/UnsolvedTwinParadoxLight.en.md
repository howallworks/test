The theory of relativity is mathematically correct and beautiful. However, what does it describe? Real positions, speeds, times and other characteristics of objects? No. The theory of relativity creates a kind of mathematical illusion that does not change the time line of each individual object. But it also does not allow us to explore the complete real picture, but only adjusts the behavior of surrounding objects so that the sequence of events does not change and the speed of objects does not exceed the speed of light.

The paper presents a simple thought experiment, which shows the calculation of the real positions, velocities and times of objects relative to two spacecraft with observers on board. Also, for this case, a special theory of relativity was applied when changing the inertial frame of reference to calculate the positions, velocities and times of objects, which turn out to be some kind of mathematical illusion. This illusion does not reflect the real characteristics of the objects.

As a result, in the basis inertial frame of reference, we calculate the real parameters of objects, and when changing the inertial frame of reference, we calculate some illusory parameters of objects. Are the laws invariant in these inertial frames of reference? No, because in the first case we describe reality, and in the second an illusion. This proves a violation of the first postulate of the theory of relativity.

The results also prove that various inertial reference frames are unequal and cannot be described by general laws. This leads to an understanding of the absoluteness of the structure of the universe. In fact, the paper assumes that there is a specialized inertial frame of reference, which is at rest within the framework of the absolute universe. The method of obtaining it and the reason for the good correspondence of the theory of relativity to experimental data are described.

### Introduction

The twin paradox is the thought experiment which was invented after Einstein formulated the special theory of relativity. In this experiment, it is not clear which object is experiencing time dilation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Then several scientists pointed out that there is no paradox. They have come up with a number of methods to explain what is happening in this thought experiment [8,9,10,11,12,13]. However, the thought experiment itself is simplified as much as possible and does not show the completeness of the problem of using the theory of relativity.

If we analyze what exactly the application of Einstein's special theory of relativity gives us in practice, then the results will allow us to rethink a lot. Let's do a thought experiment to prove it.

### Thought experiment proving the inequality of inertial reference frames 

For further description, it is necessary to introduce a new term.

An immobile frame of reference (ImFR) is an inertial frame of reference (IFR) associated with an object characterized by zero shift of cosmic microwave background radiation (zero dipole anisotropy). The ImFR can be associated with different objects, but their relative velocity is zero. It should be particularly noted that the ImFR differs from the reference frame associated with the Earth by only a few hundred kilometers per second. This is the main reason why most calculations according to the theory of relativity are close to real experimental results.

Next, we will need several formulas of the special theory of relativity.

Time dilation or space compression factor:

$1/\gamma=F(v) = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$, (1)

where $v$ is the velocity of the object relative to IFR or ImFR.

As is known, if IFR $K'$ moves relative to IFR $K$ with a constant velocity $v$ along the $x$ axis, and the origin of the spatial coordinates coincide at the initial moment of time in both systems, then the direct Lorentz transformations have the form:

$x'={\frac {x-vt}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}$ ,
$y' = y$ ,     
$z' = z$ ,
$t'={\frac {t-(v/c^{2})x}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}$, (2)

where $c$ is the speed of light, the primed values are measured in the system $K'$, unprimed — in $K$.

Thought experiment description:

In ImFR, there are two spacecrafts in the same place and time at the beginning of a thought experiment. The first one is always at rest and the second one moves at a speed of $v$ relative to ImFR. At the beginning of the thought experiment, the clocks on the spacecrafts are synchronized. After a time of $t_1$, according to the clock of the first observer, the second spacecraft will pass the distance $l=vt_1$. For an observer on the second spacecraft, time $t_2=t_1/\gamma$ will pass due to the effect of time dilation. In fact, if a ruler is placed along the axis of motion of the second spacecraft, which rests in the ImFR, then the second observer, after time $t_2$, will fix the traveled distance $l$ on it. Then we calculate the speed at which the spacecraft of the first observer was moving away according to the clock of the second observer: $v'=l/t_2=v\gamma$. These are the real locations of objects, speeds and time on the clock. 

If we apply special relativity theory with Lorentz transformations to change IFR for this case, then the result will be fundamentally different and create a mathematically correct illusion:

$v''=l''/t_2=\frac {(l/\gamma)}{(t_1/\gamma)}=v$. 

However, we know perfectly well that $l''$ is only the apparent or visible or illusory length of the ruler, and not the real one. This also means that $v''$ is also some kind of apparent or visible or illusory speed, and not real. We get that if we need to calculate the real characteristics of objects, and not illusory ones, then the theory of relativity cannot be applied. 

As a result, first we calculated the real locations, speeds, time and other characteristics of objects, and after applying the special theory of relativity when changing IFR, we calculated the apparent or visible or illusory ones. Are the laws invariant in these inertial frames of reference? No, because in the first case we describe reality, and in the second an illusion. Therefore, when using the theory of relativity, the first postulate is violated.

The special theory of relativity describes the behavior of each object mathematically correctly in each specific experiment. The reason is that for this object, the sequence of events and its own time line do not change when the IFR is changed, and the behavior of the surrounding objects adjusts accordingly. However, this mathematical description is just an illusion that does not allow us to understand what is really happening to the objects under explore.

### Conclusion

The theory of relativity is mathematically beautiful and consistent. However, the solution of the problem by its means will be real experimentally in one inertial frame of reference, but illusory in another inertial frame of reference. The reason for this is that different IFRs are unequal and do not reflect reality when described by general laws.

Of course, the assumption that it is the ImFR that is the inertial reference frame, relative to which everything in the universe is correctly calculated, requires careful verification. However, it can be argued that Einstein's theory of relativity is erroneous, since it does not correctly describe the real behavior of objects in the universe qualitatively and quantitatively, but generates only a kind of illusion.

The results also prove that different IFRs are unequal and cannot be described by general laws. This leads to an understanding of the absoluteness of the structure of the universe. In fact, it is assumed that the ImFR is at rest within the framework of an absolute universe. This is the basis for building the concept of the absolute universe. Based on this, it is the speed relative to the ImFR that is the key parameter determining how much time the clock will show.
