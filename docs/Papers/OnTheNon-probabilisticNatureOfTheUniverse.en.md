In order to understand whether our universe is predetermined or probabilistic, let's look at the physical basis of probability.

Let's consider a simple experiment. We have a hundred numbered cubes in a box, and we arrange them identically before each experiment. Then each time we take a cube located in the same corner of the box. We always get a cube with the same number and the probability of getting it in the experiment is $1$. It is important to note that if we fully reproduce the initial and external conditions, as well as the actions in the experiment itself, we always get a cube with the same number. Moreover, we won't even know that there are cubes with other numbers in the box.

If, before starting each experiment, we shake the box thoroughly and try to guide our hand inside the box randomly, then with a sufficient number of experiments, the probability of pulling a cube with the same number will tend to $0.01$.

We get that the essence of probability is to conduct a series of different experiments in which the initial and external conditions, as well as actions, are not identical. It turns out that we intentionally create such conditions in a series of experiments in order to get different results.

We create different conditions and get different results. We create identical conditions and get identical results.

Everything is clear with macro objects, but what about quantum objects? Identicaly. If we cannot or do not want to recreate identical experimental conditions, we will also get a series of different results. A good example is the Large Hadron Collider, in which quantum particles with different velocities, interaction vectors, phases in the particles themselves (the mutual state of quarks in their composition) and other characteristics collide. In this example, we get a series of different results due to different experimental conditions for quantum objects, as well as in the case of macro objects. Now let's look at the quantum experiment of the collision of atoms or ions with energy much lower than a certain threshold (at which these quantum objects will scatter into their components), and we get that their probability of remaining in their original form tends to $1$. Next, let's look at the quantum experiment of the collision of atoms or ions with energy much higher than a certain threshold (at which these quantum objects will scatter into their components), and we get that their probability of remaining in their original form tends to $0$.

As a result, the probability in the case of both macro objects and quantum objects is a consequence of imperfect experimental conditions, and not a property of our universe. If we conduct experiments with different conditions, we get different results. If we conduct experiments with identical conditions, we get identical results. 

As a result, the physics of our universe is unambiguous and predetermined, which leads us to the only path - fate.
