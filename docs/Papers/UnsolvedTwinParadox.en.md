After Einstein formulated the special theory of relativity (STR), scientists came up with a thought experiment in which it is not clear which object is experiencing "time dilation" - the Twin Paradox. However, although this does not follow from the special theory of relativity, then scientists who consider STR to be correct pointed out that there is no paradox, since a twin experiencing acceleration will experience time dilation. But this is true only for a narrow range of cases and is generally incorrect. Let's conduct a thought experiment to prove it.

Let's take two short-lived particles obtained at the same time (starships with synchronized clocks will also work), let their initial velocity $v$ relative to an immobile frame of reference (ImFR) /vacuum/zero shift of the relic radiation(zero dipole anisotropy)/with an error relative to the Earth.

The beginning of the experiment. They fly together. Let $v=0$. Let's accelerate them up to $0.5c$. We will accelerate the first to a speed close to the speed of light, and the second to 0. We will wait for a considerable time $t$. Let's accelerate both back up to $0.5c$. Let's accelerate them both up to 0. Let's accelerate them both up to $-0.5c$. We will accelerate the first to a speed close to $-c$, and the second to 0. We will wait for a considerable time $t$. Let's accelerate them both up to $-0.5c$. Let's accelerate them both up to 0. They fly together. The end of the experiment.

From the point of view of each of the particles (you can also check with starships), they moved and accelerated the same relative to each other, and this is the true version of the Twin Paradox. From the point of view of each of the particles, the other was moving faster, and the accelerations were the same. And here the special theory of relativity is powerless without the introduction of outside observers, even taking into account accelerations. Moreover, if an outside observer moves at a speed close to the speed of light relative to the ImFR/vacuum/zero shift of the relic radiation(zero dipole anisotropy)/with an error relative to the Earth, he will make an erroneous assumption about which particle will decay first.

Suppose that then you will argue that the second particle, although accelerated as well, but then slowed down and only then moved for a long time $t$. Because of this, its "clock" will show a longer time and it will decay first. Let's show that this is generally a misconception.

The beginning of the experiment. They fly together. Let $v=0.5c$. Let's accelerate the first one to 0, and the second one to $c$. Let's wait a considerable time $t$. Let's accelerate both back up to $0.5c$. We will accelerate the first to $0.6c$, and the second to $0.4c$. Let's wait a considerable time for $5t$. Let's accelerate them both up to $0.5c$. They fly together. The end of the experiment. For each of the two objects in this case, from the point of view of the theory of relativity, the velocities and accelerations were the same, which means the same amount of time should pass.

However, in reality this is not the case: 

- object 1: $t_1=F(0)t+F(0.6c)(5t)=t+4t=5t$; 
- object 2: $t_2=F(c)t+F(0.4c)(5t)=0+4.58t=4.58t$; 
, where $F(v) = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$. 

The beginning of the experiment. They fly together. Let $v=-0.5c$. Let's accelerate the first one to $-c$, and the second one to 0. Let's wait a considerable time $t$. Let's accelerate both back up to $-0.5c$. We will accelerate the first to $-0.4c$, and the second to $-0.6c$. Let's wait a considerable time for $5t$.  Let's accelerate them both up to $-0.5c$. They fly together. The end of the experiment. For each of the two objects in this case, from the point of view of the theory of relativity, the velocities and accelerations were the same, which means the same amount of time should pass. 

However, in reality this is not the case:  

- object 1: $t_1=F(-c)t+F(-0.4c)(5t)=0+4.58t=4.58t$; 
- object 2: $t_2=F(0)t+F(-0.6c)(5t)=t+4t=5t$; 
, where $F(v) = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$. 

For the last two cases, exactly the same thing happened with objects, but due to the different initial velocity relative to the ImFR/vacuum/zero shift of the relic radiation(zero dipole anisotropy)/with an error relative to the Earth, the opposite results were obtained. However, from the point of view of the theory of relativity, there is absolutely no difference.

With other initial velocities relative to the ImFR/vacuum/zero shift of the relic radiation(zero dipole anisotropy)/with an error relative to the Earth and variations in accelerations, other variants of the results will be obtained, but the essence is the same - Einstein's theory of relativity cannot correctly solve the Twin Paradox.
