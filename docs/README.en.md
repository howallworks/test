The theory of everything described here is the unification, addition, detailing, refinement and correction of all the dominant concepts and theories at the moment - the general theory of relativity, the Standard Model, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory and others. The theory of everything describes all elementary particles and fundamental interactions. Although the description is presented in the simplest language, it will most likely be interesting to a small group of people. Now the situation in the world is extremely unstable and it has become extremely difficult to predict even the near future for our planet, for me and my family. And because of this, my goal is that the theory of everything will not be lost to humanity. It may not seem fully detailed and elaborated to you, but I (taking it as a basis) get answers (as a consequence of the theory of everything) to any questions that are in good agreement with reality. I should immediately note that you should never consider any theory to be fully consistent with reality. This is a key mistake that greatly hinders the search for truth. I will only ask you to finish reading the theory of everything to the end, and not give up reading after a couple of lines, because even if you consider it fundamentally erroneous, you will at least be able to use parts of it or something in it that will lead to an interesting idea.

### Physics of the universe → Representation of the physics of the universe → Numerical mathematical description of the representation of the physics of the universe

If you have started reading the theory of everything, then first I will answer the basic question that most people have: "_Where exactly is mathematics here?_».

In order to answer this question, it is necessary to first define the term mathematics. Mathematics is the science of numerical structures, order and relations, which historically developed on the basis of operations of counting, measuring and describing the shape of objects.

"_Matematics... the science of quantitative relations and spatial forms of the real world_". – Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.

Mathematics itself is not a description of the world. It is a means for quantitative description, formalization of something. Moreover, it is possible to mathematically describe even an absolutely illusory world, and from the point of view of mathematics everything will be absolutely correct, but this does not mean that this description is our world. For this reason, I do not agree with Kolmogorov's words about the "_real world_". In addition, it is worth noting that mathematics does not belong to the natural sciences, but is widely used in them for the exact formulation of their content. Based on the above, from my point of view, mathematics is the science of the numerical description of something.

Generally speaking, mathematics allows us to obtain an absolutely correct quantitative description of a qualitatively incorrect representation of physics. And the problem is that from the point of view of mathematics, everything is fine.

For a correct description of the world, it is necessary to describe its physics (a qualitative representation of the world), and only then, if necessary, it is possible to quantitatively describe the resulting physical structure by means of mathematics and in no case vice versa.

Physics of the universe → Representation of the physics of the universe → Numerical mathematical description of the representation of the physics of the universe

In the theory of everything, I describe exactly the representation of the physics of the universe/world (elementary particles, their systems and the laws of interaction of elementary particles and systems, as well as the consequences arising from all this).
