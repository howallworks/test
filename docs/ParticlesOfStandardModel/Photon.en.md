Photon ($photon^+$ или $photon^-$) - is a particle, a carrier of electromagnetic interference. It is not elementary. It consists of a group [[Quantum photon.en|quantum photons]], or rather, either exclusively of $q.ph.^+$($photon^+$), or exclusively of $q.ph.^-$($photon^-$). 

There is a high probability that when flying in space, a photon (group of quantum photons) has the structure of a disk (a figure - circle), since photons are subject to the phenomenon of light polarization. This is indicated by a drop in light intensity when passing through a polarizing filter. The polarizing crystal, apparently, passes the "disks" of photons in a certain plane and completely blocks them with a perpendicular orientation. You can imagine a lot of parallel flat slots. If the "disk" of the photon is parallel to the slit, then the photon passes through the polarization crystal without hindrance, and if it is perpendicular, then the photon will hit the "grid" of the polarization crystal and will not pass. Photons from the intermediate orientations of the "disk" can both pass through and "get stuck" depending on the size of the "disk" and the slit.
