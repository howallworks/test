[**Accretion disk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk) is a structure (often a [circumstellar disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_disk "Circumstellar disk")) formed by diffuse material in [orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") motion around a massive [central body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_(astronomy) "Primary (astronomy)"). The central body is typically a [star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"). [Friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction"), uneven irradiance, [magnetohydrodynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics "Magnetohydrodynamics") effects, and other forces induce instabilities causing orbiting material in the disk to spiral inward towards the central body. Gravitational and frictional forces compress and raise the temperature of the material, causing the emission of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation"). The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object's mass. Accretion disks of young stars and [protostars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar "Protostar") radiate in the [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared "Infrared"); those around [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star") and [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole") in the [X-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") part of the [spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum). The study of oscillation modes in accretion disks is referred to as **diskoseismology**.
