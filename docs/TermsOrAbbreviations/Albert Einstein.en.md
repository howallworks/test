[**Albert Einstein**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born [theoretical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics"),\[[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-Bio-8)\] widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity"), but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of [modern physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics "Modern physics")\[[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-frs-4)\]\[[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-YangHamilton2010-9)\] His [mass–energy equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence") formula $E = mc^2$ (["Mass–energy equivalence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence#Mass–velocity_relationship "Mass–energy equivalence")), which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".\[[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-LnLVo-10)\] His work is also known for its influence on the [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science").\[[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-xZQWt-11)\]\[[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-3UiiT-12)\] He received the 1921 [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect "Photoelectric effect")",\[[12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-Nobel_Prize-13)\] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".\[[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-wordnetweb.princeton.edu-14)\]

In 1905, a year sometimes described as his _[annus mirabilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis "Annus mirabilis")_ ('miracle year'), Einstein published [four groundbreaking papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers "Annus Mirabilis papers").\[[14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalison2000377-15)\] These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion"), introduced [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"), and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") could no longer be reconciled with those of the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field "Electromagnetic field"), which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe").\[[15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-Nobel-16)\]\[[16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-NYT-20151124-17)\] He continued to deal with problems of [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the [motion of molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion"). He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"), which laid the foundation of the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") theory of light.

However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that "God does not play dice".\[[17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-18)\] Second, he attempted to devise a [unified field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory "Unified field theory") by generalizing his geometric theory of [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") to include [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"). As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics").

Einstein was born in the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire"), but moved to [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland") in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the [Kingdom of Württemberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg "Kingdom of Württemberg"))\[[note 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-GEcitizen-1)\] the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss [Federal polytechnic school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich "ETH Zurich") in [Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich"), graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the [Swiss Patent Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Institute_of_Intellectual_Property "Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property") in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the [University of Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Zurich "University of Zurich"). In 1914, Einstein moved to [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin") in order to join the [Prussian Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences "Prussian Academy of Sciences") and the [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_University_of_Berlin "Humboldt University of Berlin"). In 1917, Einstein became director of the [Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Wilhelm_Institute_for_Physics "Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics"); he also became a German citizen again, this time [Prussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia "Prussia").

In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") came to power in Germany. Einstein, as Jewish, objected to the policies of the newly elected [Nazi government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany");\[[18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-zE9Bz-19)\] he settled in the United States and became an [American citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_citizen "American citizen") in 1940.\[[19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-BoyerDubofsky2001-20)\] On the eve of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), he endorsed [a letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd_letter "Einstein–Szilárd letter") to President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") alerting him to the potential [German nuclear weapons program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nuclear_weapons_program "German nuclear weapons program") and recommending that the US begin [similar research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project "Manhattan Project"). Einstein supported the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") but generally denounced the idea of [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons "Nuclear weapons").\[[20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#cite_note-21)\]
