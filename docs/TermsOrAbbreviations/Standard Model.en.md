The [**Standard Model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics") is the [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory") describing three of the four known [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_force "Fundamental force") ([electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [weak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction") and [strong interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction")) excluding gravity in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") and classifying all known [elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle"). It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists worldwide,\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model#cite_note-1)\] with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon [experimental confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_confirmation "Experimental confirmation") of the existence of [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"). Since then, proof of the [top quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark "Top quark") (1995), the [tau neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_neutrino "Tau neutrino") (2000), and the [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson "Higgs boson") (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of [weak neutral currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_neutral_current "Weak neutral current") and the [W and Z bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons") with great accuracy.

Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent\[[note 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model#cite_note-3)\] and has demonstrated huge successes in providing [experimental predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_prediction "Experimental prediction"), it leaves some [phenomena unexplained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_standard_model "Physics beyond the standard model"). It falls short of being a [complete theory of fundamental interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything "Theory of everything"). For example, it does not fully explain [baryon asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry "Baryon asymmetry"), incorporate the full [theory of gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_gravitation "Theory of gravitation")\[[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model#cite_note-4)\] as described by [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), or account for the [universe's accelerating expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe "Accelerating expansion of the universe") as possibly described by [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"). The model does not contain any viable [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter") particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology"). It also does not incorporate [neutrino oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation "Neutrino oscillation") and their non-zero masses.

The development of the Standard Model was driven by [theoretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics "Theoretical physics") and [experimental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_physics "Experimental physics") particle physicists alike. The Standard Model is a paradigm of a [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory") for theorists, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena, including [spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking "Spontaneous symmetry breaking"), [anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_(physics) "Anomaly (physics)"), and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate [hypothetical particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_particle "Hypothetical particle"), [extra dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_dimensions "Extra dimensions"), and elaborate symmetries (such as [supersymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry "Supersymmetry")) to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.
