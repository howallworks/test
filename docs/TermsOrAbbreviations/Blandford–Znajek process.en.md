The [**Blandfordâ€“Znajek process**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blandford%E2%80%93Znajek_process) is a mechanism for the extraction of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") from a [rotating black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_black_hole "Rotating black hole"),\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blandford%E2%80%93Znajek_process#cite_note-1)\]\[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blandford%E2%80%93Znajek_process#cite_note-2)\] introduced by [Roger Blandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Blandford "Roger Blandford") and [Roman Znajek](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roman_Znajek&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roman Znajek (page does not exist)") in 1977.\[[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blandford%E2%80%93Znajek_process#cite_note-3)\] This mechanism is the most preferred description of how [astrophysical jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet "Astrophysical jet") are formed around spinning [supermassive black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole "Supermassive black hole"). This is one of the mechanisms that power [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar "Quasar"), or rapidly accreting supermassive black holes.\[[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blandford%E2%80%93Znajek_process#cite_note-:0-4)\] Generally speaking, it was demonstrated that the power output of the accretion disk is significantly larger than the power output extracted directly from the hole, through its ergosphere.\[[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blandford%E2%80%93Znajek_process#cite_note-5)\]\[[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blandford%E2%80%93Znajek_process#cite_note-6)\] Hence, the presence (or not) of a poloidal magnetic field around the black hole is not determinant in its overall power output. It was also suggested that the mechanism plays a crucial role as a central engine for a [gamma-ray burst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst "Gamma-ray burst").\[[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blandford%E2%80%93Znajek_process#cite_note-7)\]
