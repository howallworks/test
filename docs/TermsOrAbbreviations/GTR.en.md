[**General relativity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity), also known as the **general theory of relativity(GTR)** and **Einstein's theory of gravity**, is the [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry "Differential geometry") [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory "Scientific theory") of [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") published by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") in 1915 and is the current description of gravitation in [modern physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics "Modern physics"). General [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity") generalizes [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") and refines [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"), providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics "Time in physics") or [four-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_space "Four-dimensional space") [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"). In particular, the _[curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature "Curvature") of spacetime_ is directly related to the [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") of whatever [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") and [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") are present. The relation is specified by the [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations"), a system of second order [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation").

[Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"), which describes classical gravity, can be seen as a prediction of general relativity for the almost flat spacetime geometry around stationary mass distributions. Some predictions of general relativity, however, are beyond [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation") in [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics"). These predictions concern the passage of time, the [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") of space, the motion of bodies in [free fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_fall "Free fall"), and the propagation of light, and include [gravitational time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation "Gravitational time dilation"), [gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens "Gravitational lens"), the [gravitational redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_redshift "Gravitational redshift") of light, the [Shapiro time delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro_time_delay "Shapiro time delay") and [singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity "Gravitational singularity")/[black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_holes "Black holes"). So far, all [tests of general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity "Tests of general relativity") have been shown to be in agreement with the theory. The time dependent solutions of general relativity enable us to talk about the history of the universe and have provided the modern framework for [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology "Cosmology"), thus leading to the discovery of the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") and [cosmic microwave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background "Cosmic microwave background") radiation. 

Reconciliation of general relativity with the laws of [quantum physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") remains a problem, however, as there is a lack of a self-consistent theory of [quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity "Quantum gravity"). It is not yet known how gravity can be [unified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything "Theory of everything") with the three non-gravitational forces: [strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction"), [weak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction "Weak interaction") and [electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism").

Einstein's theory has [astrophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical "Astrophysical") implications, including the prediction of [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_holes "Black holes")â€”regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"), can escape from them. Black holes are the end-state for [massive stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_star "Massive star"). [Microquasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microquasar "Microquasar") and [active galactic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus "Active galactic nucleus") are believed to be [stellar black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_black_hole "Stellar black hole") and [supermassive black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole "Supermassive black hole"). It also predicts [gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lensing "Gravitational lensing"), where the bending of light results in multiple images of the same distant astronomical phenomenon. Other predictions include the existence of [gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave "Gravitational wave"), which have been [observed directly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gravitational_wave_observations "List of gravitational wave observations") by the physics collaboration [LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO "LIGO") and other observatories. In addition, general relativity has provided the base of [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology "Physical cosmology") models of an [expanding universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space "Metric expansion of space").

Widely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary [beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty "Mathematical beauty"), general relativity has often been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.\[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity#cite_note-:0-2)\]
