The [**Penrose process**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process) (also called **Penrose mechanism**) is theorised by [Sir Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose "Roger Penrose") as a means whereby energy can be extracted from a [rotating black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_black_hole "Rotating black hole").\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process#cite_note-1)\]\[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process#cite_note-2)\] The process takes advantage of the [ergosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergosphere "Ergosphere") --- a region of spacetime around the black hole [dragged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging "Frame-dragging") by its rotation _faster than the speed of light_, meaning that from the point of an outside observer any matter inside is forced to move in the direction of the rotation of the black hole.

In the process, a working body falls (black thick line in the figure) into the [ergosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergosphere "Ergosphere") (gray region). At its lowest point (red dot) the body fires a propellant backwards; however, to a faraway observer both seem to continue to move forward due to [frame-dragging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging "Frame-dragging") (albeit at different speeds). The propellant, being slowed, falls (thin gray line) to the event horizon of the black hole (black disk). And the remains of the body, being sped up, fly away (thin black line) with an excess of energy (that more than offsets the loss of the propellant and the energy used to shoot it).

The maximum amount of energy gain possible for a single particle decay via the original (or classical) Penrose process is 20.7% of its [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_mass#Rest_energy "Invariant mass") in the case of an uncharged black hole (assuming the best case of maximal rotation of the black hole).\[[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process#cite_note-efficacy-3)\] The energy is taken from the rotation of the black hole, so there is a limit on how much energy one can extract by Penrose process and similar strategies (for an uncharged black hole no more than 29% of its original mass;\[[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process#cite_note-4)\] larger efficiencies are possible for [charged rotating black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr%E2%80%93Newman_black_hole "Kerrâ€“Newman black hole")\[[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process#cite_note-5)\]).
