[**Helicity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicity_(particle_physics)) — characterization of the particle state. Helicity is the projection of the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics) "Spin (physics)") onto the direction of motion. Used when describing particles moving at or near the speed of light. Is a conserved [Lorentz invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_covariance) quantity for [massless particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massless_particle).

Distinguish:

1. Negative or "left" — the spin is directed against the direction of motion of the particle;
2. Positive or "right" — the spin is directed along the motion of the particle.
