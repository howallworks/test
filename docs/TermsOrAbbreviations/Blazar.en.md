[**Blazar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar) is an [active galactic nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus "Active galactic nucleus") (AGN) with a [relativistic jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet "Astrophysical jet") (a jet composed of [ionized matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") traveling at nearly the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light")) directed very nearly towards an observer. [Relativistic beaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_beaming "Relativistic beaming") of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") from the jet makes blazars appear much brighter than they would be if the jet were pointed in a direction away from Earth.\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar#cite_note-1)\] Blazars are powerful sources of emission across the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum "Electromagnetic spectrum") and are observed to be sources of high-energy [gamma ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray "Gamma ray") [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon"). Blazars are highly variable sources, often undergoing rapid and dramatic fluctuations in brightness on short timescales (hours to days). Some blazar jets exhibit apparent [superluminal motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superluminal_motion "Superluminal motion"), another consequence of material in the jet traveling toward the observer at nearly the speed of light.

The blazar category includes [BL Lac objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BL_Lacertae_object "BL Lacertae object") and [optically violently variable (OVV) quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OVV_quasar). The generally accepted theory is that BL Lac objects are intrinsically low-power [radio galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_galaxy "Radio galaxy") while OVV quasars are intrinsically powerful radio-loud [quasars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar "Quasar"). The name "blazar" was coined in 1978 by astronomer [Edward Spiegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Spiegel "Edward Spiegel") to denote the combination of these two classes.\[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar#cite_note-2)\]

In visible-wavelength images, most blazars appear compact and pointlike, but high-resolution images reveal that they are located at the centers of [elliptical galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy "Elliptical galaxy").\[[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar#cite_note-3)\]

Blazars are important topics of research in [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") and [high-energy astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-energy_astronomy "High-energy astronomy"). Blazar research includes investigation of the properties of [accretion disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk "Accretion disk") and [jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet "Astrophysical jet"), the central [supermassive black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole "Supermassive black hole") and surrounding host [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"), and the emission of high-energy [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photons "Photons"), [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray "Cosmic ray"), and [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino").

In July 2018, the [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory "IceCube Neutrino Observatory") team traced a [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino "Neutrino") that hit its [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica")-based detector in September 2017 to its point of origin in a blazar 3.7 billion [light-years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year "Light-year") away. This was the first time that a [neutrino detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_detector "Neutrino detector") was used to locate an object in space.\[[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar#cite_note-NYT-2018-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar#cite_note-Guardian-2018-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar#cite_note-BBC-2018-6)\]

Blazars are one of the most energetically powerful phenomena in the universe.

Objects of this class show brightness variability at various wavelengths and time scales from hours to tens of years, detect high (up to 10%) and variable linear polarization of radiation in all spectral ranges (up to 10%). Due to the jet's orientation towards the observer and the high plasma velocity in the jet (95-99% of the speed of light), imaginary superluminal motions are observed near the core of the blazars.
