[**Relativistic jets**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jet) are very powerful jets of [plasma](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics) "Plasma (physics)") with speeds close to the speed of light.\[[1](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jet#cite_note-1)\] They are [emitted](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission "Emission") by the central [black holes](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole") of some [active galaxies](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus "Active galactic nucleus") (notably [radio galaxies](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_galaxy "Radio galaxy") and [quasars](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar "Quasar")), and by the black holes of massive stars and [neutron stars](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star"). Their lengths can reach several thousand or even hundreds of thousands of [light years](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_years "Light years").\[[2](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jet#cite_note-2)\]\[[3](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jet#cite_note-3)\]

If the jet speed is close to the [speed of light](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), the effects of the [special theory of relativity](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_theory_of_relativity "Special theory of relativity") are significant. The mechanics behind how jets are created,\[[4](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jet#cite_note-4)\]\[[5](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jet#cite_note-5)\] and what they are made of, are still a matter of debate.\[[6](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jet#cite_note-6)\] Jet composition might vary.\[[7](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jet#cite_note-7)\]\[[8](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_jet#cite_note-auto-8)\]

Massive galactic central black holes have the most powerful jets. Similar jets on a much smaller scale develop from [neutron stars](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star") and black holes in other stars. Even weaker and less relativistic jets may be associated with many [binary star](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star "Binary star") systems.

The general hypothesis among astrophysicists is that the formation of relativistic jets is the key to explaining the production of [gamma-ray bursts](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst "Gamma-ray burst"). These jets have [Lorentz factors](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor "Lorentz factor") of ~100 or greater (that is, speeds over roughly 0.99995[c](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light")), making them some of the fastest celestial objects known at present.
