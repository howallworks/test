The deflection of light during the annihilation of an electron-positron pair with decay into photons and gravitons.

Assumption: if an electron and a positron consist of a quantum photons and a quantum gravitons, then they will be released during annihilation.

We are currently detecting photons in such experiments, and gravitons can be detected by light deflection in long-arm detectors such as LIGO. That is, although the deflection effect will be small, but at a long distance of the photon travel after the deflection will still take place. 

Additional assumption: it is possible that gravitons may be radiated unevenly.

This means that if we emit a photons stream in the shape of a circle, and annihilation is carried out in its center, then the deflection of photons will be uneven and, possibly, even local.

The main problem is the difficulty of estimating the magnitude of this deflection effect during gravitational ejection at the moment of annihilation, since we usually deal with the emission of gravitons by mass, and not with the loss of stability of particles with separation into components.

It is assumed that electrons, positrons and other particles with mass contain a lot of quantum photons and quantum gravitons. This is now confirmed experimentally by the detection of high-energy photons during the annihilation of an electron-positron pair.

The advantage of annihilation of an electron-positron pair is that if only photons and gravitons fly apart, then the photons do not interact with each other and do not interfere with the detection of gravitational effects.
